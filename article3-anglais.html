                    In this article, we are going to turn to the first chapters.<br>
                    The first chapters look at his childhood, around the age of 3 to 13 years old.<br> <br>
                    Going through her excision, rape, and forced marriage.

                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>
                    The book begins when she meets a lion in the desert after she has run away from home, then we saw her in the past.<br>
                    At the age of 3, she followed her mother, a friend and her sister to see what this famous passage of excision is to finally be a woman.<br>
                    Having seen what it was, that did not stop this strong desire to be excised.<br><br>
                    Her excision was at the age of 5, her mother held her against a rock with her legs and the old woman excised her.<br>
                    She tells us that before excision, the woman takes out a damaged razor blade, with dried blood on it, and that she spat on the blade before starting.

                <p>
                    Afterwards she was taken to a hut alone for 2 weeks, with her legs linked so that it would heal and not open.<br>
                    She had a small infection but not too serious. However, one of her sisters and one of her cousins ​​died after excision.

                <p>
                    After excision, the father protects his daughters from sexual relations and rape, so that they remain “intact” the day they marry another man.<br>
                    They are preserved, the goal being that it is the husband who reopens the vagina on the wedding night.<br><br>
                    At the age of 13, she wanted to marry a man who was interested in her sister, but one day, taking care of the camels her sister came to pick her up telling her that her father had a husband for her. Going to see the man, she saw that it was a 60 year old man. This man offered in exchange 5 camels.<br>
                    She therefore decided to flee, in the middle of the night, she ran away from the hut, without any belongings, food or water.<br>
                    The next day, her father catches up with her, but has not been able to bring her back<br>
                    Another morning, when she woke up, she had a lion in front of her, but the lion did not eat her. Maybe out of pity or because there was nothing to eat on it.<br> <br>
                    Arriving on a road, she hitchhiked, one day a truck stopped.<br>
                    Inside was the conductor and two men. She went alone to the back, over stones, but in the middle of the night, a man came towards her. He tried to rape her, but she hit him with a stone, and ran away.

                    After she finally managed to get to a town in Somalia, she looked for where her uncle lived.<br>
                    A man offered to help him, took him home, gave him something to eat, and told him to go take a “nap”.<br>
                    A few years before, a man had offered her the same thing and tried to rape her. So she flees.<br>
                    On leaving, an old lady asked her who she was looking for, and accompanied her to her uncle. <br><br>
                    To know the rest, I invite you to read the book Desert Flower, which is really interesting and teaches us a lot of things.
